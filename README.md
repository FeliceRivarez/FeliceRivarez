**Hi there, this is FeliceRivarez.**

My Chinese name is Yifei Zhang (张逸非). Though I have an English name (Neil, the English given name my parents chose for me), it turns out that people prefer "Yifei" over "Neil", as Yifei is easy to pronounce for English speakers (thanks to my mom who actually took this into consideration upon the selection of my Chinese name), and Neil seems a little old-fashioned.

I am currently an undergraduate in the College of Computer Science, Nankai University. Feel free to drop an email, you can reach me at 1802771190@qq.com, or yifeizhang@mail.nankai.edu.cn.

My current research interest is mainly authentication and password security. I am also looking forward to research in other aspects of cyber/information security. Anonymous Messaging and End-to-End encryption would be of great interest, if I have the time to dive into the field in the future. 

Previous course repos(public) include:

- Programming with C++
- Programming with Python

Under construction:

- Parallel Programming

Publication:

- EditPSM: A New Password Strength Meter Based on Password Reuse via Deep Learning
  
  **Yifei Zhang**, Zhenduo Hou, Yunkai Zou, Zhen Li, Ding Wang. In Proc. INSCRYPT 2024 (**CCF-C**), to appear.

Awards:

- Cryptography National Contest'24, China, held by CACR. Finalist, **Second Prize**. （2024全国密码技术竞赛，**全国决赛二等奖**）

  I personally servered as the presenter and drafted/polished the report, completed the artifact in part. In the group phase of the finals, we ranked the first.
  However, in a last minute notice, the score for the preliminary round is also a part of the final score (the prelims took place 2 months before the finals, and was never
  a part of the final result in previous editions of the competition). Due to this sudden change of rules, we lost the chance to win the first prize.

- Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, National contest'24, China. **Second Prize (Tianjin)**. （2024全国大学生数学建模竞赛，**天津市二等奖**）

  I personally served as team leader, model designer, and programmer.
  
In this semester(Fall 2024), courses I am taking include：
- Operating System
- Computer Architecture
- Compilers
- Computer Network
- NLP
- Computer Graphics.

I will make repositories for some of these courses public after the end of this semester. If I am allowed to, public repos to appear include NLP and Computer Graphics. Repos for other courses will probably not be made public since there are already numerous other repos for reference.

Private repos other than course repos are for research purposes. Though I'd very much like to make them public, it remains unknown whether I am allowed to do so, considering research ethics and anonymity of paper submissions. For now, I simply use these repos for code backup and version control.

I am considering making a homepage for myself, probably in Dec. 2024, mostly for my upcoming technical blogs and research-related inspirations. Other contents may include a gallery, a TODO list, etc.
