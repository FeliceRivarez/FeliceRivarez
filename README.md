**Hi there, this is FeliceRivarez.**

My Chinese name is Yifei Zhang (张逸非). Though I have an English name (Neil, the English given name my parents chose for me), it turns out that people prefer "Yifei" over "Neil", as Yifei is easy to pronounce for English speakers (thanks to my mom who actually took this into consideration upon the selection of my Chinese name), and Neil seems a little old-fashioned.

I am currently an undergraduate in the College of Computer Science, Nankai University. My homepage is at [https://felicerivarez.github.io](https://felicerivarez.github.io), it is still under construction and may be glitchy. Feel free to drop an email, you can reach me at yifeizhang@mail.nankai.edu.cn.

My current research interest is mainly authentication and password security. I am also looking forward to research in other aspects of cyber/information security. AI security, as well as AI for security, will be topics I'd like to dive into in the future. On top of these, anonymous Messaging, End-to-End encryption and deniable encryption would also be of great interest, if I have the time to look into them in the future. 

Previous course repos(public) include:

- Programming with C++ (Final project ranked #1 in the College of CS. Course final score: 94/100)
- Programming with Python (Score: 96/100)
- Computer Graphics (Score: 100/100)
- Natural Language Processing (Score: 96/100)
- Deep Learning (Advanced course, score: 94/100)
- Speech Recognition (Score: 98/100)

Under construction:

- Parallel Programming (When I have the time LOL)

Publication:

- EditPSM: A New Password Strength Meter Based on Password Reuse via Deep Learning
  
  **Yifei Zhang**, Zhenduo Hou, Yunkai Zou, Zhen Li, Ding Wang. In Proc. INSCRYPT 2024 (**CCF-C**), **Best Paper runner-up** (3 out of 47 total accepted/conditional accept papers), pages 255-276. [[PDF (via publisher)]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-4731-6_13) [[PDF (Not final)]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387090294_EditPSM_A_New_Password_Strength_Meter_Based_on_Password_Reuse_via_Deep_Learning) [[video]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Zhk1YqECC?vd_source=a77cc3ee011649af678918fbe9172a5c)

<!--- - One paper under submission with me being the first author (in a CCF-A security conference, conference name is not specified for anonymity in the review process). --->

- At least 2 papers under preparation with me being the first author. These papers will be targeting top-tier security conferences.

Awards:

- Cryptography National Contest'24, China, held by CACR. Finalist, **Second Prize**. （2024全国密码技术竞赛，**全国决赛二等奖**）

  I personally served as the presenter and drafted/polished the report, completed the artifact in part. In the group phase of the finals, we ranked first.
  However, at a last-minute notice, the score for the preliminary round is also a part of the final score (the prelims took place 2 months before the finals, and were never
  a part of the final result in previous editions of the competition). Due to this sudden change of rules, we lost the chance to win the first prize.

- Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, National contest'24, China. **Second Prize (Tianjin)**. （2024全国大学生数学建模竞赛，**天津市二等奖**）

  I personally served as team leader, model designer, and programmer.
  
In the remaining semesters of my undergraduate days (Fall 2025 & Spring 2026), I am no longer required to take any courses. I will be focusing on my research and my thesis for a Bachelor's in Engineering.

Private repos other than course repos are for research purposes. Though I'd very much like to make them public, it remains unknown whether I am allowed to do so, considering research ethics and the anonymity of paper submissions. For now, I simply use these repos for code backup and version control.

<!--- I am considering making a homepage for myself, probably in Jan. 2025 (sorry~ I had to prepare for INSCRYPT presentation and my finals in Dec. 2024), mostly for my upcoming technical blogs and research-related inspirations. Other contents may include a gallery, a TODO list, etc. --->
