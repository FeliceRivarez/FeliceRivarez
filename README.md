**Hi there, this is FeliceRivarez.**

I am currently an undergraduate in College of Computer Science, Nankai University.

My research interest is mainly authentication and password security. However, End-to-End encryption would also be of great interest, if I have the time to dive into the field in the future.

In this semester(Fall 2024), courses I am taking include Operating System, Computer Architecture, Compilers, Computer Network, NLP, and computer graphics. I will make repositories of these courses public after the end of this semester, if I am allowed to.
