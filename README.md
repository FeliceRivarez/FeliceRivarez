**Hi there, this is FeliceRivarez.**

My Chinese name is Yifei Zhang (张逸非). Though I have an English name (Neil, the English given name my parents chose for me), it turns out that people prefer "Yifei" over "Neil", as Yifei is easy to pronounce for English speakers (thanks to my mom who actually took this into consideration upon the selection of my Chinese name), and Neil seems a little old-fashioned.

I am currently an undergraduate in the College of Computer Science, Nankai University. Feel free to drop an email, you can reach me at 1802771190@qq.com, or yifeizhang@mail.nankai.edu.cn.

My current research interest is mainly authentication and password security. I am also looking forward to research in other aspects of cyber/information security. Anonymous Messaging, End-to-End encryption and deniable encryption would be of great interest, if I have the time to dive into the field in the future. 

Previous course repos(public) include:

- Programming with C++ (Final project ranked #1 in the College of CS. Course final score: 94/100)
- Programming with Python (Score: 96/100)
- Computer Graphics (Score: 100/100)
- Natural Language Processing

Under construction:

- Parallel Programming (ETA Feb. 2025)

Publication:

- EditPSM: A New Password Strength Meter Based on Password Reuse via Deep Learning
  
  **Yifei Zhang**, Zhenduo Hou, Yunkai Zou, Zhen Li, Ding Wang. In Proc. INSCRYPT 2024 (**CCF-C**), **Best Paper runner-up** (3 out of 47 total accepted/conditional accept papers). To appear. [[PDF (Not final ver.)]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387090294_EditPSM_A_New_Password_Strength_Meter_Based_on_Password_Reuse_via_Deep_Learning) [[video]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Zhk1YqECC?vd_source=a77cc3ee011649af678918fbe9172a5c)

- At least 2 papers are in preparation with me being the first author. These papers will be targeting USENIX security, ACM CCS, S&P, and NDSS.

Awards:

- Cryptography National Contest'24, China, held by CACR. Finalist, **Second Prize**. （2024全国密码技术竞赛，**全国决赛二等奖**）

  I personally served as the presenter and drafted/polished the report, completed the artifact in part. In the group phase of the finals, we ranked the first.
  However, in a last minute notice, the score for the preliminary round is also a part of the final score (the prelims took place 2 months before the finals, and was never
  a part of the final result in previous editions of the competition). Due to this sudden change of rules, we lost the chance to win the first prize.

- Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, National contest'24, China. **Second Prize (Tianjin)**. （2024全国大学生数学建模竞赛，**天津市二等奖**）

  I personally served as team leader, model designer, and programmer.
  
In the upcoming semester(Spring 2025), courses I am taking include：
- Computer system design (计算机系统设计，专业必修课)
- Software engineering
- Deep learning (Advanced) (深度学习-高阶，专业选修课)
- Big data computation and application （大数据计算与应用，专业选修课）

At the end of spring 2025, course repos to appear include those for deep learning and big data (subject to change). Repos for other courses may also be made public.

Private repos other than course repos are for research purposes. Though I'd very much like to make them public, it remains unknown whether I am allowed to do so, considering research ethics and anonymity of paper submissions. For now, I simply use these repos for code backup and version control.

I am considering making a homepage for myself, probably in Jan. 2025 (sorry~ I had to prepare for INSCRYPT presentation and my finals in Dec. 2024), mostly for my upcoming technical blogs and research-related inspirations. Other contents may include a gallery, a TODO list, etc.
