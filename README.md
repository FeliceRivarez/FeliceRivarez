**Hi there, this is FeliceRivarez.**

I am currently an undergraduate in College of Computer Science, Nankai University.

My research interest is mainly authentication and password security. However, Anonymous Messaging and End-to-End encryption would also be of great interest, if I have the time to dive into the field in the future.

Previous course repos(public) include:

- Programming with C++
- Programming with Python

Under construction:

- Parallel Programming

In this semester(Fall 2024), courses I am taking include：
- Operating System
- Computer Architecture
- Compilers
- Computer Network
- NLP
- Computer Graphics.

I will make repositories for some of these courses public after the end of this semester. If I am allowed to, public repos to appear include NLP and Computer Graphics. Repos for other courses will probably not be made public since there are already numerous other repos for reference.
